### Why I made this project
I LOVE cafes, and I also adore cats. So, how cool would making my own cat cafe be? However, I also love the beauty of space and reading science fiction. 
In combining these interests, I arrived at the idea for an intergalactic space cafe, partly inspired by Star War's fancy space bars. And since I wanted to experiment 
with Javascript, I decided to make the cafe experience into a personality quiz.

### Coding Process
- Used my background knowledge in basic HTML and CSS, then self-learned JavaScript
- Watched additional tutorial videos for CSS masking and animation
- Learn JavaScript through documentation and tutorial videos
- Struggled with JavaScript and CSS Animations, but was able to continue watching videos to figure out my quiz
